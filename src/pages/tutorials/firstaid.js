          Accidents can happen anytime and anywhere, as motorcycle riders, we
          are always prone to such cautions. It is better for the riders to know
          proper first-aid as this can ensure additional safety and can lessen
          risk

        <TutorialsH2>1. CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)</TutorialsH2>
        <br></br>
        <TutorialsP>When you suspect someone is in cardiac arrest:</TutorialsP>
        <UnivList>
          <LocList>
            1. Get someone to call 911 or the medical alert system for your
            location.
          </LocList>
          <LocList>
            2. Start chest compressions immediately. Push down hard and fast in
            the center of the chest, allowing the chest to come back up
            naturally between compressions. Continue until someone with more
            training has arrived.
          </LocList>
          <LocList>
            3. If you're trained in CPR, use chest compressions and rescue
            breathing.
          </LocList>
          <LocList>
            4. Use an AED if one is available. It's important to not delay chest
            compressions, though, so have someone else find one while you do
            chest compressions.

        <TutorialsP>If you're faced with bleeding:</TutorialsP>
        <UnivList>
          <LocList>1. Rinse the wound with water if possible.</LocList>
          <LocList>
            2. Cover the wound with a gauze or cloth (towel, blanket, clothing,
            whatever's available).
          </LocList>
          <LocList>
            3. Apply direct pressure to stop the blood flow and encourage
            clotting.
          </LocList>
          <LocList>
            4. If possible, elevate the bleeding body part above the heart.
          </LocList>
          <LocList>
            5. Don't remove the cloth if it becomes soaked through, but add more
            layers if needed. Removing the first layer will interfere with the
            clotting process and result in more blood loss.
          </LocList>
          <LocList>6. Once bleeding is stopped, apply a clean bandage.</LocList>

          Treating frostbite is a delicate procedure of gradual warming. If at

          facility. If that's not possible, or while awaiting an ambulance, you
          can begin first aid:

          </LocList>
          <LocList>6. Loosely wrap the area with bandages.</LocList>

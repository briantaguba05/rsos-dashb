          Communication between the riding group is essential at all times.
          Using hand signals can greatly boost their communication thus reducing
          confusion and conflict.

              <TutorialsP2>
                For letting the group know you are turning left. The signal can
                be used to break from or to lead the group, depending on whether
                you are leading or following. Make the signal by extending your
                left arm straight out with your palm facing down.

              <TutorialsP2>
                Let the group know you are turning right. Use this signal to
                lead or to break from the group, depending on your status in the
                group (leading or following). Bend your elbow 90 degrees, then
                point your clenched fist at the sky to complete the signal.

              <TutorialsP2>
                When the leader of the group makes the “stop” signal, it should
                cause a chain reaction going all the way back to the last rider
                in the group. Make the signal by bending your arm 90 degrees,
                keeping your palm open, and pointing your fingers down at the
                road.

                Inexperienced groups will benefit most from this signal.
                Experienced groups rely more on body language. Use it to tell
                the rest of the group to match your pace by increasing their
                speed. Extend your arm and swing your palm in an upward
                direction to give the signal.

              <TutorialsP2>
                This signal is useful because motorcycles generate intense
                engine-braking forces, which do not activate the rear-facing
                brake light. Extend your arm and swing your palm down toward the
                road to tell everyone in the group to slow down.

              <TutorialsP2>
                AKA the “YOU! Follow me!” signal. It has 2 distinct parts. Start
                by pulling up alongside the rider you want to follow or lead. In
                one motion, point to their bike and then swing your arm forward.
                Repeat this motion until the other rider understands.

                This is a “2 in 1” signal. The signal is different depending on
                whether the hazard is to the right or the left. If the hazard is
                on the left, point with your left arm. Point with your right
                foot if the hazard is on the right.

                An easy gesture. Extend your left index finger and bend your arm
                up to the sky. In other words, pretend the riders behind you are
                asking “How many?” and then indicate the answer by gesturing
                with your left pointer finger.

                this stop only when the road or shoulder is debris-free and

                straw poking up out of a glass of water.

                signal to let another rider know he left his blinker on,
                allowing him to save face during the next comfort or refreshment
                stop.

                comfort or refreshment stop.

                finger.
